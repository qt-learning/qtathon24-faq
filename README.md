# Qt;athon 2024
## Frequently Asked Question

### Some tests are not passing and staying stuck. What can I do?

Due to the many changes in the repository during the event, it might be a case that the Actions of the fork might get stalled.
The problem should be fixed after some minunutes, so in case you notice persist for a longer time, please email the organizers.

### I noticed code from another participant in my repo, is that correct?

We noticed some participants had issues when submitting their solutions, and mistakenly pushed to the main repository.
Please notify the organizers if you see something like this, and we will remove it promptly.
You can always fix that locally and push your own solution to your repository, because that will be reviewed.

### Do we need to use Qt?

For the first round it's not mandatory. We encourage you to use standard C++ or Python for your solutions.
The second round will require Qt.

### I have problems pushing to main, how can I solve it?

When cloning the repository, make sure you are getting the repository from your assigned team,
and review the remotes of your repository in case that's misconfigured.
You can either push directly to your main branch or open Pull Requests on your repository.

### What's the argument we need to use for our solution?

Depending on the task, you might need to pass one string argument to your program,
or more than one. Please follow the instructions of each task to comply with the challenge.

### There are some extra commits in my new project repository. Is that normal?

The commits you see in the history of your repository comes from the main repository that was used
for the challenge. Don't worry about them and merge your Pull Requests accordingly.

### Does squares work as solution for Task 3? because it says rectangles.

Yes, a square is a type of rectangle.

### The `.yml` file seems to be wrongly configured, because some checks are not passing.

In case you continue to see this issue, contact the organizers. Changes were provided during 30.10.2024
to fix this issue.

### I see some conflicts on my Pull Requests. What should I do?

It might be that we pushed fixed for other issues to all the repositories, so you might need
to solve the conflicts on your first merge. In case you are running out of time, it's OK
to keep the Pull Requests open with your solutions, and they will be taken care when reviewing
your challenge.

### How will the grading system test Test 3? Should I use an array or a vector?

The grading system will receive input as written. Input will not be put in quotation marks.
This means, you will have to collect multiple arguments and pre-process them. You can use either
vector or array, problem can be solved either way.
